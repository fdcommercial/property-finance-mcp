/**
 * BRIDGING COST ANALYSER
 *
 * Models the total cost of a UK bridging loan across rolled-up, retained,
 * and serviced interest structures. Ported from the FD Commercial mobile
 * app at fdcommercial.co.uk/app/ to ensure web/mobile/MCP return
 * identical numbers for the same inputs.
 *
 * The single most useful comparison this tool produces is the side-by-
 * side cost across all three interest structures. Two lenders quoting
 * the same headline rate can produce different total costs once structure
 * choice is factored in. Rolled-up compounds monthly. Retained and
 * serviced run flat (simple) interest but with different cash flow.
